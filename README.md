This was an earlier Java project I had worked on that runs a GUI prompt that allows user to choose specific File ,
Program reads from file and displays graph. 


Studying this project now, I can see that it was only partially correct. The depth first searching seemed to work well,
but some of the paranthesis and 'unreachable' nodes are still missing from the prompt/compilation .

User is able to Search GUI Directory easily, Find "TestExamples.txt" files and run them accordingly, I will
have to come back to this program to fix the paranthesis/unreachable nodes.
